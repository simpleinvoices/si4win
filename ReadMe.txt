# Simple Invoices For Windows

Simple Invoices For Windows is a combination of the simple invoices web app and a custom portable webserver. Simple Invoices For Windows
will allow you to use or just try Simple Invoices without having to own or configure a webserver. Simple Invoices For Windows doesn't require
you to install it to your computer, once unzipped you can move the SimpleInvoices folder anyplace on your computer or even to a USB drive to take with you to another computer.

This Windows based version of Simple Invoices is maintained by John McLaren at http://TeamMC.cc/SimpleInvoices  -  john@teammc.cc

Support may be offered by emailing John or by visiting the Simple Invoices forum at http://www.simpleinvoices.org

==Limitations & Special Considerations:==

	* Simple Invoices offers you a quick and easy way to email an invoice using the SMTP protocol, this function could experience problems. Follow the Simple Invoices instructions like normal for configuring email and make sure you use SSL/Secure settings.
	   
	* Simple Invoices allows you to setup recurring invoices (i.e. monthly automatic billing). This feature uses a webserver feature called 'cron', this feature is not available in a portable webserver such as the one used for Simple Invoices For Windows and no workaround is currently known.

	* Simple Invoices For Windows uses a custom configured portable webserver and database server, these services use a network connection to communicate with each other even though they remain on the same computer, some antivirus programs or firewalls might try to block these connections
	
	* Using Simple Invoices For Windows on a computer that has an installation of Apache, MySQL or PHP could cause problems, please report these issues along with details about your configuration
	
==Instructions:==

	* Unzip the "Simple Invoices For Windows" folder to your desktop, hard drive or a portable USB drive.
	* Run "SimpleInvoices.exe" inside the "Simple Invoices For Windows" folder
	* Select one of the following:
		* "GUI" to start Simple Invoices in its own window.
		* "Browser" to start Simple Invoices in you web browser (close Simple Invoices using its tray icon).
	* Follow the instruction on screen to configure Simple Invoices.
	* If advanced or specific configuration is necessary for Simple Invoices, simply navigate and edit the Simple Invoices Installation in the "www" folder.

==Configuration:==

	To configure options for Simple Invoices itself please visit [Install]  or  http://code.google.com/p/simpleinvoices/wiki/Install

	To configure options specific to "Simple Invoices For Windows" (not Simple Invoices)
	open and edit Settings.ini in the "Simple Invoices For Windows" folder. 
	Here is an explanation of some options you will see in Settings.ini.

	* GUI=1
		* Setting this to 0 will not allow the user to choose the GUI option when starting Simple Invoices

	* Browser=1
		* Setting this to 0 will not allow the user to choose the DefaultBrowser option when starting Simple Invoices.

	* PromptGUIBrowser=1
		* Setting this to 0 will not prompt the user to choose the startup method of Simple Invoices, 
		* Whatever method is enabled will be the one to start, if both are enabled or disabled the GUI method will be used.

	* TrayIcon=0
		* Settings this to 1 will show a system tray icon giving you a few simple functions (Browser mode forces the tray icon to appear).

	* PHPMyAdmin=1
		* Setting this to 0 will hide the options to open the database manager PHPMyAdmin,
		* Note that PHPMyAdmin can still be accessed manually in a web browser given the correct URL, to make PHPMyAdmin inaccessible you may remove or move the contents of the 'phpmyadmin' folder

	* ToggleServer=1
		* Setting this to 0 will hide the options to start and stop the server.

	* WebAddress=localhost
		* Setting this to blank will allow other computers on your network to access SimpleInvoice given the correct URL.
		* For this to work other factors need to be accounted for, including network configuration and firewall settings.
		* The URL should be in this format: http://*IP*:*port* check settings.ini for "WebPort"

	* WebPort=8877
		* Change this only if you get a message saying apache won't start and you suspect that another program on your computer is using this port.

	* SQLServer,SQLAddress,SQLPort
		* Advanced settings for the MySQL server, change these only if you have a port conflict or want to disable the SQL server to use a remote server.
		* Note that changing these settings will require you to reconfigure Simple Invoice's 'config.ini'
